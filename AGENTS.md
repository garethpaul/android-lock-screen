## Repository purpose

`garethpaul/android-lock-screen` is currently an empty placeholder for an Android custom lock-screen experiment. No Android implementation, Gradle project, tests, or app behavior have been committed yet.

## Project structure

- `Makefile` - repository verification targets
- `scripts` - baseline checks and helper scripts
- `docs` - plans, notes, and generated README assets

## Development commands

- Install dependencies: no repository-specific install command is documented.
- Full baseline: `make check`
- Combined verification: `make verify`
- Lint/static checks: `make lint`
- Tests: `make test`
- Build: `make build`
- If a command above skips because a platform toolchain is missing, verify on a machine with that SDK before claiming platform behavior is tested.

## Coding conventions

- Follow the existing file layout and naming used by the checked-in sample.

## Testing guidance

- No dedicated test files were detected; treat `make check` as the minimum baseline.
- Start with the narrowest relevant test or Make target, then run `make check` before handing off if the change is not documentation-only.
- Keep README verification notes in sync when commands, fixtures, or supported toolchains change.

## PR / change guidance

- Keep diffs focused on the requested repository and avoid unrelated modernization or formatting churn.
- Preserve public APIs, sample behavior, file formats, and documented environment variables unless the task explicitly changes them.
- Update tests, README notes, or docs/plans when behavior, security posture, or validation commands change.
- Call out skipped platform validation, legacy toolchain assumptions, and any risky files touched in the final summary.

## Safety and gotchas

- A checked-in Gradle wrapper and Android Gradle Plugin version.
- Documented compile SDK, target SDK, and minimum SDK choices.
- A local test or source-check command that runs without device access.
- A build command that produces a debug APK in a configured Android SDK.
- CI or documented local gates for formatting, tests, and build verification.
- Ignore rules for generated Android artifacts and local SDK configuration.

## Agent workflow

1. Inspect the README, Makefile, manifests, and the files directly related to the request.
2. Make the smallest source or docs change that satisfies the task; avoid generated, vendored, or local-environment files unless required.
3. Run the narrowest useful validation first, then `make check` or the documented package/platform gate when available.
4. If a required SDK, service credential, or external runtime is unavailable, record the skipped command and why.
5. Summarize changed files, commands run, and remaining risks or follow-up validation.
