## Overview

`garethpaul/android-lock-screen` is an Android application or sample. Android custom lock screen

This README is based on the checked-in source, manifests, scripts, and repository metadata on the `master` branch. The project language mix found during review was: shell (1).

## Repository Contents

- `README.md` - project overview and local usage notes
- `docs` - source or example code
- `scripts` - source or example code
- `SECURITY.md` - security reporting and disclosure guidance
- `VISION.md` - project direction and maintenance guardrails

Additional scan context:

- Source directories: docs, scripts
- Dependency and build manifests: none detected
- Entry points or build surfaces: none detected
- Test-looking files: no obvious test files detected

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Android Studio or a compatible Android SDK
- Gradle or the checked-in Gradle wrapper when present

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garethpaul/android-lock-screen.git
cd android-lock-screen
```

The setup commands above are derived from repository files. Legacy mobile, Python, or JavaScript samples may require older SDKs or package versions than a modern workstation uses by default.

## Running or Using the Project

- Use Android Studio to open the project or run `gradle assembleDebug` when the Android SDK is configured.

## Testing and Verification

- `gradle test` or Android Studio's test runner when the SDK is configured

When the required SDK or runtime is unavailable, use static checks and source review first, then verify on a machine that has the matching platform toolchain.

## Configuration and Secrets

- No required secret or credential file was identified in the repository scan. If you add integrations later, keep secrets out of git.

## Security and Privacy Notes

- The scan did not identify production authentication, payment, or secret-management code. Treat future additions in those areas as security-sensitive.

## Maintenance Notes

- This looks like a legacy Android project or sample. Expect Android SDK, Gradle, and support-library versions to matter.
- See `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting and safe research guidance.
- See `VISION.md` for project direction and contribution guardrails.

## Contributing

Keep changes small and tied to the project that is already present in this repository. For code changes, document the toolchain used, avoid committing generated dependency directories or local configuration, and update this README when setup or verification steps change.
